# Project Overview

## Application Purpose

**NorthPark Learning Support** is a web-based application designed to help teachers efficiently track and manage student progress through a simple note-taking system. The application allows teachers to log in, select students from their classes, and add detailed notes about student observations, progress, and behavior.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Teachers** - K-9 grade level educators who need to track student progress
- **School Administrators** - May need access to aggregated student data

### User Personas
- **Elementary Teacher** - Manages 20-25 students across multiple subjects
- **Middle School Teacher** - Teaches specific subjects to multiple classes
- **Special Education Teacher** - Tracks detailed progress for students with IEPs

## Core Functionality

### Teacher Features
1. **Secure Authentication** - Login with email/password or OAuth
2. **Student Selection** - Browse and select students from assigned classes
3. **Note Creation** - Add detailed notes about student progress, behavior, or observations
4. **Note Management** - View, edit, and organize existing notes
5. **Class Organization** - View students organized by grade and class

### Administrative Features
1. **User Management** - Manage teacher accounts and permissions
2. **Class Assignment** - Assign teachers to specific classes
3. **Student Management** - Add/edit student information and class assignments

## Business Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Streamline Documentation** - Reduce time spent on student progress tracking
- **Improve Organization** - Centralize student notes and observations
- **Enhance Communication** - Provide structured format for student information
- **Ensure Security** - Protect sensitive student data with proper authentication

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Teachers can log in and access their classes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Note creation process takes less than 2 minutes
- [ ] 95% of teachers report improved organization of student information
- [ ] Zero data breaches or unauthorized access incidents
- [ ] 90% user satisfaction rating from teacher feedback

   - Edit and delete existing notes
   - View note history for each student

4. **Class Organization**
   - Create and manage classes within grades
   - Assign teachers to classes
   - View all students in a class

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Page load times under 2 seconds
   - Support for 100+ concurrent users
   - Responsive design for tablets and desktops

2. **Security**
   - HTTPS encryption for all communications
   - Secure authentication and session management
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Regular security audits

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
   - Accessible design following WCAG guidelines
   - Mobile-responsive layout
   - Fast note creation workflow

4. **Reliability**
   - 99.9% uptime during school hours
   - Automated backups
   - Data recovery procedures
   - Error handling and logging

## Technical Constraints

### Development Constraints
- Must use T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma)
- Deploy on Vercel or similar platform
- Use PostgreSQL database
- Implement proper TypeScript types throughout

### Operational Constraints
- Must comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
- Data must be stored securely with proper access controls
- Regular backups required
- Audit logging for all data access

### Budget Constraints
- Use open-source technologies where possible
- Minimize third-party service costs
- Efficient hosting and database usage

## Success Criteria

### Launch Criteria
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Security audit completed and passed
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation and training materials ready
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Post-Launch Success
- [ ] 80% of target teachers actively using the system
- [ ] Average note creation time under 2 minutes
- [ ] User satisfaction score above 4.0/5.0
- [ ] Zero critical security incidents
- [ ] System uptime above 99.5%

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Security** - Student information is highly sensitive
2. **User Adoption** - Teachers may resist new technology
3. **Performance** - System must handle peak usage during school hours
4. **Compliance** - Must meet educational data privacy requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Security** - Implement comprehensive security measures and regular audits
2. **Adoption** - Provide training and support, ensure intuitive design
3. **Performance** - Load testing and performance monitoring
4. **Compliance** - Legal review and compliance documentation
